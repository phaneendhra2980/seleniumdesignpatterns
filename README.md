# seleniumdesignpatterns
In software engineering, a design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.(("Software design pattern - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" 2011. 18 Jan. 2016)) Why are design patterns so important for Selenium development? It can speed up development and reduce the maintenance impact. Using design patterns in test automation development is not necessary, but a seasoned automation engineer understands the importance. If you are new to test automation, I highly recommend learning the best way to write automated tests
